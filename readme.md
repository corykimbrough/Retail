- **Where should the company focus its efforts to produce more profit?**

## Business Insights
- **Revenue Trends:** January and November are the highest revenue months  
- **Customer Value:** Top 5% of customers contribute approximately 35% of total revenue  
- **Product Profitability:** Electronics category generates the highest profit margins  
- **Customer Retention:** Repeat customers spend 2–3x more than first-time buyers  
- **Cohort Analysis:** Retention and revenue drop significantly after month 2 for most cohorts
- **The company could focus more on electronics where it profits most.
  But more importantly also on retaining customers, and especially on attracting and retaining the relatively big spenders as they make up too significant a portion of the revenue to ignore.
 I recommend doing analysis or surveys on the high spending group. Also, on learning what is making cohorts weaken after the first couple of months, if possible.**
-**I would like more data to confirm this as there is just not enough history here, but if the trend is expected to be high for End and beginning of year, efforts could be put into more advertising and promotions centered around these times to maximize profits.**
